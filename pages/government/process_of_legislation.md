# Process of Legislation

The Grand Council shall be the voting body within Icenia in regards to legislation, otherwise known as bills, put forth by members of the grand council. The process of voting on bills shall start with submission of a bill by one member of the Grand Council to the #Bills channel of the Icenian discord. Bills will then be available for the public to see. For 24 hours a “discussion” period shall be imposed on it. During this discussion period, no votes shall be cast. After the discussion period is over, voting shall take place among the members of the Grand Council. The President’s vote is considered equal in this process. If the majority vote ‘yay’ then the bill passes, and takes effect immediately after. If the bill does not pass, it is considered dead.

## Emergency/Condifential Delcaration and Bills
Bills involving emergency declarations do not have to follow the process seen in F, as they may contain sensitive or time sensitive elements to them. Emergency declarations require a ‘yay’ vote from the President and do not have to have a 24 hour discussion period, and if deemed confidential, may not be posted in any public channel.
